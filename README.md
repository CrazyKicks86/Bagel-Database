## Bagel-Database-with-MySQL

MySQL Bagel Project

This database was created for a data management class I had previously completed.  Using SQLFiddle as the source, and the empty bagel shop database 
blueprint, I created a database that would deploy the requested information when needed. Attached, are the screenshots of the created database and the 
screenshots of the working MySQL programming to allow the user to draw any needed information.  After completing the blueprints and the working MySQL,
I was then tasked to upload screenshots of the database working.

"Scenario:

You are a database designer and developer who has been hired by two local businesses, Nora’s Bagel Bin and Jaunty Coffee Co., to build databases to help them manage their businesses. First, you will design a normalized physical database model to store data for Nora’s Bagel Bin’s ordering system. Then, you will use an existing database design document for Jaunty Coffee Co. to create its database. Once the tables have been built, you will load them with sample data and create a view and an index to protect and improve query performance. Finally, you will create both a simple query and a more complex table joins query to produce meaningful reports from the newly created database."
