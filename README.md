# Bagel-Database
MySQL Bagel Project  

This database was created for a data management class I had previously completed.  Using SQLFiddle as the source, and the empty bagel shop database 
blueprint, I created a database that would deploy the requested information when needed. Attached, are the screenshots of the created database and the 
screenshots of the working MySQL programming to allow the user to draw any needed information.
